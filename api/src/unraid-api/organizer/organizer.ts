 *
 * @param view - The organizer view containing the entry definitions

 * **Behavior and Edge Cases:**

 * - **Self-inclusion**: The starting `entryId` is always included in the result set
 * - **Cycle detection**: Automatically prevents infinite loops when entries reference themselves

 * - **Missing entries**: If `entryId` doesn't exist in the view, returns an empty set (or
 *   the provided collection unchanged)
 * - **Broken references**: If a folder's children array contains IDs that don't exist in the
 *   view, those missing children are silently skipped without errors
 * - **Resource refs**: Entries with `type: 'ref'` are treated as leaf nodes - they are
 *   collected but don't traverse further (as they have no children)
 * - **Empty folders**: Folders with no children are still collected and returned
 * - **Collection mutation**: If a collection parameter is provided, it is modified in-place

 * - **Traversal order**: Uses depth-first traversal, processing folders before their children.

 * - **Reference cleanup**: Removes deleted entry IDs from ALL folder children arrays

 * - **Circular reference safe**: Handles circular folder structures without infinite
 *   loops thanks to the underlying `collectDescendants()` function.
 *
 * - **Graceful handling**: Non-existent entry IDs are silently ignored. Empty deletion
 *   sets are handled without errors.
 *
 * - **Immutability control**: By default creates a new view object (`mutate=false`).
 *   Set `mutate=true` only when you want to modify the original view in-place.
