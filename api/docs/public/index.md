# Unraid API

The Unraid API provides a GraphQL interface for programmatic interaction with your Unraid server. It enables automation, monitoring, and integration capabilities.

## Current Availability

The API is available through the Unraid Connect Plugin:

1. Install Unraid Connect Plugin from Apps
2. [Configure the plugin](./how-to-use-the-api.md#enabling-the-graphql-sandbox)
3. Access API functionality through the [GraphQL Sandbox](./how-to-use-the-api.md#accessing-the-graphql-sandbox)

## Future Availability

The API will be integrated directly into the Unraid operating system in an upcoming OS release. This integration will:

- Make the API a core part of the Unraid system
- Remove the need for separate plugin installation
- Enable deeper system integration capabilities
