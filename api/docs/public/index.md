# Unraid API Documentation

The Unraid API provides a powerful GraphQL interface for interacting with your Unraid server programmatically. It enables automation, monitoring, and integration capabilities for your Unraid system.

## Current Availability

The Unraid API is currently available exclusively through the **Unraid Connect Plugin**. To get started:

1. Install the Unraid Connect Plugin from the Apps tab
2. Configure the plugin according to your needs
3. Access the API functionality through the plugin interface

## Future Availability

The API will be integrated directly into the Unraid operating system in an upcoming OS release. This integration will:

- Make the API a core part of the Unraid system
- Remove the need for separate plugin installation
- Enable deeper system integration capabilities
