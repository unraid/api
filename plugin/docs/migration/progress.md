# Plugin Migration to Slackware Package: Progress Report

## Completed Tasks
- Created standard Slackware package description file (`slack-desc`) for the dynamix.unraid.net package
- Added `doinst.sh` script to handle post-installation tasks like creating symlinks and starting services
- Removed Node.js symlinking from both the doinst.sh script and plugin file as this will be handled by the build-txz script
- Moved all setup and cleanup scripts from the plugin file to the doinst.sh script
- Implemented support for both install and remove operations in doinst.sh using Slackware's installation mode parameter
- Modularized the installation logic into separate scripts for better maintainability:
  - `setup_api.sh`: Handles API setup, symlinks, and service startup
  - `file_patches.sh`: Manages file patches and system configurations
  - `cleanup.sh`: Performs uninstallation and cleanup operations
- File restoration scripts have been successfully migrated from the plugin's inline code to the modular cleanup.sh script, with improved organization using functions
- Enhanced cleanup.sh to handle both installation and removal scenarios with a mode parameter ('restore' or 'cleanup')
- Updated doinst.sh to call cleanup.sh with the appropriate mode for both installation and removal operations
- Ensured POSIX shell compatibility by replacing Bash-specific array syntax with POSIX-compliant for loops
- These changes follow Slackware packaging conventions for proper integration with the OS
- Removed the now-redundant file restoration block from the plugin file
- Removed redundant cleanup commands from the plugin XML file as they've been properly migrated to the Slackware package scripts
- Simplified the plugin XML file by removing all cleanup code, as these operations are now entirely handled by the Slackware package system via removepkg
- Simplified the unsupported OS handling code to just display a warning message and exit gracefully rather than performing complex cleanup operations
- Updated the removal script to rely on the Slackware package system instead of manually running cleanup operations
- Consolidated all cleanup scripts into a single robust shell script:
  - Merged functionality from the PHP `cleanup_operations.php` script into the shell-based `cleanup.sh`
  - Removed dependency on PHP for cleanup operations, making the process more compatible with native Slackware tooling
  - Created a unified script that handles both file restoration (during installation) and full cleanup (during removal)
  - Added a mode parameter to control which operations are performed
  - Completely removed the legacy PHP cleanup script (cleanup_operations.php)
- Eliminated duplicate cleanup scripts by:
  - Removing the redundant script at install/scripts/cleanup.sh
  - Standardizing on the version at usr/local/share/dynamix.unraid.net/install/scripts/cleanup.sh
  - Ensuring all script references point to the canonical script location
- Improved doinst.sh script maintainability:
  - Added SCRIPTS_DIR variable to centralize script paths
  - Replaced all hardcoded script paths with the variable reference
  - Makes future path changes easier to implement by only requiring a single edit
- Eliminated duplicate setup_api.sh scripts by:
  - Removing the redundant script at install/scripts/setup_api.sh
  - Standardizing on the version at usr/local/share/dynamix.unraid.net/install/scripts/setup_api.sh
  - Following the same pattern used for cleanup.sh consolidation

## Next Steps
- Review and ensure all file permissions are set correctly
- Test package installation and removal
- Verify that all services start correctly after installation
- Ensure proper dependency handling 
- Convert PHP version compatibility check to a shell script
- Implement vendor archive handling in the package structure
- Create complete SlackBuild script with proper:
  - Build process
  - File permissions
  - Directory structure
- Add TAG handling from plugin XML file
- Create post-installation verification to ensure all files are properly installed
- Document complete migration process with testing results

## Recently Completed
- Implemented proper Slackware init system integration:
  - Modified `rc.unraid-api` script to include standard start/stop/restart/status functions
  - Added boot-time node modules dependency restoration to the `start()` function
  - Removed service startup from `setup_api.sh` as it's now handled by the init system
  - Created proper init system symlinks in `doinst.sh` for runlevel 3 (startup) and 0/6 (shutdown)
  - Moved environment setup from setup_api.sh to rc.unraid-api to ensure it's available at boot
  - The service will now properly start on boot if pre-installed in the OS
  - Node modules will be automatically restored from the vendor archive if missing at boot

## Notes
- Disk space verification checks are not needed in the native package since it will be pre-installed in Unraid
- Gzip availability checks are unnecessary for the native package
- DNS resolution checks are unnecessary and should be removed from the plugin file
- Plugin staging conflict check is outdated and no longer needed
