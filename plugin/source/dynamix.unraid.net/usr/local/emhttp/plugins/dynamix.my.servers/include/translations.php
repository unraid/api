/**
 * Welcome to the Thunderdome. A place where you can get lost in a sea of translations.
 *
 * This file is used to generate the translations for the Vue3 based web components.
 *
 * These key value pairs are derived from web/locales/en_US.json.
 * We use the en_US.json file as the source of truth for the translations.
 * This file is then used to generate the translations for the web components and delivered to them via PHP as a JSON object in myservers2.php (my favorite file name).
 * The web components then use the translations to display the appropriate text to the user.
 *
 * Workflow is as follows:
 * 1. Create a new translation in en_US.json
 * 2. Create a new translation in this file
 * 3. Open unraid/lang-en_US and add the new translation to the appropriate file – typically translations.txt.
 * 3a. This is done so that the translation is available to the rest of the Unraid webgui.
 * 3b. Unfortunately there are numerous "special characters" that aren't allowed in Unraid's translation keys as they're automatically stripped out.
 * 3c. This means that we have to create a new translation key that is a "safe" version of the translation key used in the web components.
 * 3d. Special characters that are not allowed are: . ( ) { } [ ] ; ' " < > * /
 * 3e. There are likely more but I'm unable to find the documentation PDF. Go figure.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * $wCTranslations = new WebComponentTranslations();
 * $wCTranslations->getTranslations();
 * ```
